        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1648 	Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana  was born on November 12th, 1648 in San Miguel Nepantla, near Mexico City.</li>
          <li>1656  Composed her first poem at the tender age of 8</li>
          <li>1661	Taught Latin to young children. She longed to disguise herself as a male so that she could go to University but was not given permission by her family to do so.</li>
          <li>1664	At 16 years old, she had comprehensively studied Greek Logic. She was presented to the court of Viceroy Marquis de Mancera, where she was admitted to the service of the Viceroy’s wife</li>
          <li>1669  Joined the order of St Jerome, so she could continue her self-studies. In the Convent, Sor Juana had her own study and library and was able to talk often with scholars from the Court and the University. Besides the writing of poems and plays, her studies included music, philosophy and natural science. Her small room was filled with books, scientific instruments and maps. Though accomplished, Sor Juana was the subject of criticism by her political and religious superiors.</li>
          <li>1690	A letter of hers which criticized a well-known Jesuit sermon was published without her permission by a person using the pseudonym “Sor Filotea de la Cruz.” Included with her letter was a letter from “Sor Filotea” (actually the Bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fernandez de Santa Cruz) criticizing Juana for her comments and for the lack of serious religious content in her poems. Sor Juana’s reply, the now famous Respuesta a Sor Filotea has been hailed as the first feminist manifesto, defending, among other things, a woman’s right to education</li>
          <li>1695 A plague hit the convent. On April 17, after tending to her fellow sisters, Juana died from the disease around the age of forty-four.</li>

        <h3>Famous Work</h3>

        <h4>Foolish Men</h4>

        <p>You foolish men who lay<br>
        the guilt on women,<br>
        not seeing you’re the cause<br>
        of the very thing you blame;
        </p>

        <p>if you invite their disdain<br>
        with measureless desire <br>
        why wish they well behave <br>
        if you incite to ill.
        </p>

        <p>You fight their stubbornness,<br>
        then, weightily,<br>
        you say it was their lightness<br>
        when it was your guile.</p>

        <p> In all your crazy shows <br>
        you act just like a child <br>
        who plays the bogeyman <br>
        of which he’s then afraid.</p>

        <p>With foolish arrogance <br>
        you hope to find a Thais <br>
        in her you court, but a Lucretia <br>
        when you’ve possessed her.</p>

        <p>What kind of mind is odder <br>
        than his who mists <br>
        a mirror and then complains <br>
        that it’s not clear.</p>

        <p>Their favour and disdain <br>
        you hold in equal state,<br>
        if they mistreat, you complain, <br>
        you mock if they treat you well.</p>

        <p>No woman wins esteem of you:<br>
        the most modest is ungrateful <br>
        if she refuses to admit you; <br>
        yet if she does, she’s loose.</p>

        <p>You always are so foolish<br>
        your censure is unfair;<br>
        one you blame for cruelty <br>
        the other for being easy.</p>

        <p>What must be her temper <br>
        who offends when she’s <br>
        ungrateful and wearies <br>
        when compliant?</p>

        <p>But with the anger and the grief <br>
        that your pleasure tells <br>
        good luck to her who doesn’t love you <br>
        and you go on and complain.</p>

        <p>Your lover’s moans give wings <br>
        to women’s liberty: <br>
        and having made them bad,<br>
        you want to find them good.</p>

        <p>Who has embraced <br>
        the greater blame in passion?<br>
        She who, solicited, falls,<br>
        or he who, fallen, pleads?</p>

        <p>Who is more to blame,<br>
        though either should do wrong?<br>
        She who sins for pay <br>
        or he who pays to sin?</p>

        <p>Why be outraged at the guilt <br>
        that is of your own doing?<br>
        Have them as you make them <br>
        or make them what you will.</p>

        <p>Leave off your wooing <br>
        and then, with greater cause,<br>
        you can blame the passion <br>
        of her who comes to court?</p>

        <p>Patent is your arrogance <br>
        that fights with many weapons <br>
        since in promise and insistence <br>
        you join world, flesh and devil.</p>
